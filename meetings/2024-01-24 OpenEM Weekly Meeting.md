## Organizational
- New repo for notes & docs: [openem-docs](https://github.com/SwissOpenEM/openem-docs) (private)
    - Could be replaced by confluence
- Meeting organization
    - Suggestion to have daily/regular standup meetings (15 minutes to review status)
    - 9:30-9:45 Mon, Tues, Thurs, Fri?
    - Attendance is optional. I will likely miss some too.
- Kanban choice
    - Taiga vs Github project
